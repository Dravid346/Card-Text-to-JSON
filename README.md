Often, I write up custom cards for games like Magic or for my own custom card games in plaintext. I figured I might want to write some programs that interact with my cards, such as auto-generating images for them, but to do that I'd need to turn my cards into data objects to make them easier to use. This is some code to do that, by processing the text files and saving the resulting data as a JSON file for later. You can try using it or expanding on it for other games or to actually do something with the data objects. For now, I've got code for Magic The Gathering and for my own game Braithia, along with example inputs and outputs for both. There might be some Magic cards that can't be properly written in the required format, but it's good enough.
